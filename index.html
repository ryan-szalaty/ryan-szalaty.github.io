          Your business deserves efficient and productive teams to generate
          revenue, and your team deserves a new member who is highly adaptible,
          open-minded, and inclined to refine their skills. Even better is
          someone who has been immersed in a foreign culture and business and
          can bring a unique blend of teamwork and language skills to the table.
          <span>If this sounds like someone who may be a good match</span>, I
          invite you to read on.

          April 3rd, 2023, 9:30AM. Golden-orange sunlight lit the brand-new
          space that I had moved into, and the freshly-brewed cup of dark-roast
          coffee wafted through the room. It was my second month of onboarding
          with a fintech company in Tokyo as an external recruiter. After
          spending eight months interviewing and finally being accepted into a
          great team, the first sips of morning coffee were sweeter than they
          had ever been. I was scheduled to have a morning chat with my manager,
          so I opened the Zoom link and was greeted by the usual solemn, yet
          friendly face.

        <p>
          His eyes, though, betrayed an intention to match the air of that
          lovely morning, and the next few words that quivered out of his mouth
          will forever remain in my memory.

          April 3rd, 9:32AM. That moment flipped the 3-month hourglass that
          remained to find another job or face deportation. Although that time
          was my most humbling, it lit two different sparks, one of which would
          grow into a more potent flame.

          The latter led me to produce the text you are kindly reading. Born out
          of necessity and built from a desire to carve out a better life, my
          desire to break into tech came to full light.

          Making the very website that you are looking at now! The essentials of
          HTML, CSS and JavaScript are all here, and further below, you can have
          a look at some of the other projects I have done. It's always being
          updated, too!

          React in the frontend connected to MongoDB as the backend database was
          quite challenging as there were many factors that were new to me,
          including React Router 6, which apparently threw the entire tech
          community for a loop. Using React, though, was quite fun, and it has
          become my favorite JavaScript-based frontend framework.

          What was most challenging, though, was going through Harvard's CS50
          course on YouTube. Seeing that C is the grandfather of programming
          languages, it included entirely new concepts such as pointers and
          memory allocation that I had never needed to consider before.
        </p>
        <p>
          Still, if I was going to be competitive against those who graduated
          with a traditional four-year degree in computer science, I was going
          to have to hunker down and get my hands dirty. And I'm glad I did.
          You'll see the return on investment with some of my best projects
          below, both in programming and in illustration!

          opportunity to work as a web developer and provide a better future for
